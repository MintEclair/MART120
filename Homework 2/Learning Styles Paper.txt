Learning styles, as I’ve come to find out, are a funny thing. Some people swear by their existence and do their best to cater to them, while others claim they are made up with just another personality quirk like the Myers-Briggs test. 

I think “learning style” should be renamed “learning preference” cause that’s what it is—a preference. Someone may enjoy learning from a video, while the other hates it. Both people will still learn something, albeit one may be able to retain more information than the other. The most important part of learning is being engaged in the material and connecting with it somehow. Learning preferences can help people achieve both much better. Then again, I understand why people believe it doesn’t mean anything. Learning preferences can be used as an excuse in order not to try to retain and connect with the information, and as a result, this can cause a lot of frustration on both ends. 

Learning preferences can and do help people retain information. However, people must understand that learning still requires effort. No learning style will magically make information easier to learn.
