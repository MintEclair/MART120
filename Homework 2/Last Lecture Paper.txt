The concept of a “last lecture” is already a terrifying one. For some, the last lecture may be a proper send-off before passing off the torch; for others, it may just be the last lecture they gave before they quit giving lectures or if they met an untimely end. As a result, the title of this lecture intrigued me to find out more. 

As I watched the video, I noticed the main thing he was talking about was other people. Sure, he spoke of who he was at the start and how he got to where he is, but the main thing he mentions is the people who helped him along the way and the people he supported. At first, it didn’t seem like he was giving off significant life-changing advice, but the more I watched, the more I realized the actual message. That the people in your life are essential and you can’t do everything alone. He shows off gratitude to the people who taught him, the people he taught, and the people in his personal life, such as his wife, towards the end. 

I resonate with this message greatly because it made me take a step back and realize how important the people in my life are. Whether they were great people who enriched my life in unimaginable ways or people who caused the most inner turmoil and devastation, they still got me to where I am today. They all have taught me one way or another, making me appreciate the people in my life for whatever role they play. Whether it’s the friends I made so far or the table in the Food Zoo that I think might be gossiping about me cause I messaged one of the guys who sits there on Grindr, they all play an essential role in one way or another. I’m even grateful for the events and friends I haven’t made yet because, like a river that bends and diverts, they will help me get to where I need to be. 

This lecture was a refreshing step back and a sound reinforcement of what I am doing in this class and at this university. It helps fill me with determination, and I look forward to what the future brings.
