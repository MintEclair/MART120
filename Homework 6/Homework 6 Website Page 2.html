Birth of Medusa 

<p>What day was it when<br>
she became a cursed monster<br>
for all eternity by the gods?<br>
Snakes emerged from her head</p> 

<p>in place of her hair.<br>
Their stare, venom enough, was<br>
a glaring warning for any <br>
who approached. Those who caught</p>

<p>Her gaze eye to eye <br>
were then turned into stone<br>
leaving Medusa alone, isololated,<br> 
and unloved. She cries, wondering</p>

<p>What she did to deserve<br>
this. Was it the price<br> 
of her beauty? Was it<br>
the price of wanting love?</p>

<p>This is the fate of<br> 
Medusa. Forever to live her<br> 
life as a monster. Never<br> 
knowing what she did wrong.</p> 

Wowie zowie! That's some poetry all right! Here is some art XD<br>
